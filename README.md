# csci-473-pi-estimation-project

This project contains two small command-line applications that estimate the value of pi by finding the nth sum of the following alternating series. 

4 * sigma(k=0, infinity) {(-1)^k / 2k + 1}

Both application execute for n iterations, where the value of n is passed as an argument to the program at runtime. The second application uses multithreading 
via the OpenMP library to execute the iterations in parallel and takes an additional argument that allows the user to specify the number of threads to be used. 


### Important Note
This project is no longer under active development.
